I am a highly motivated individual with experience in research and software engineering. Currently, I am a Teaching Assistant and Graduate Research Assistant at Lehigh University, where I am pursuing a PhD in Computer Science. In this role, I have gained extensive experience in teaching and conducting research, which has allowed me to develop strong problem-solving and analytical skills.

Prior to Lehigh University, I earned a Master's degree in Data Science from Drexel University and worked as a Graduate Research Assistant and Digital Development Camp Counselor. During this time, I gained valuable experience in data analysis and programming, as well as in leadership and mentorship.

In addition to my academic and research experience, I also have experience working as a Software Engineer at Contemi Solutions in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. In this role, I developed my skills in software development and project management, working on a variety of projects to support clients in the finance industry.

My undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology from Vietnamese-German University rounds out my technical expertise. In this program, I also participated in extracurricular activities, including the VGU Football Club and VGU Robotics and Electronics Club.

Overall, my diverse background in research, software engineering, and computer science, coupled with my passion for learning and problem-solving, make me a strong candidate for roles in these fields.
